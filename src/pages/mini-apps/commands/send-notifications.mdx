# Send Notifications

Sending notifications has three parts:

-   Requesting the permission in the Dev Portal Advanced settings
-   Requesting permission to send notifications via minikit
-   Sending the notification

This command will be available from v1.4.0 of minikit and v2.8.72 of World App.

## Requesting permission

Here is an example of how to use the requestPermission command.
Note this modal will only allow you to show it once. If you reject it, you will need to direct the user to settings in order to re-enable this.
You can find this out by checking the `error_code` in the response.

The schema for the settings page is:

```
worldcoin.org/settings/miniapps
```

        ### Sending the command and handling the response
        ```tsx
        import { MiniKit, RequestPermissionPayload, Permission } from '@worldcoin/minikit-js'

        // Example function of how to use the command
        const requestPermission = useCallback(
            async () => {
                const requestPermissionPayload: RequestPermissionPayload = {
                    permission: Permission.Notifications,
                };
                const payload = await MiniKit.commandsAsync.requestPermission(requestPermissionPayload);
                // Handle the response
            },
            []
        );

        ### Sending the command 
        ```tsx
        // Example function of how to use the command
        const requestPermission = useCallback(
            () => {
                const requestPermissionPayload: RequestPermissionPayload = {

                },
            []
        );
        ```

        ### Handling the response
        ``` tsx {{ title: 'app/page.tsx' }}
        import { MiniKit, tokenToDecimals, Tokens, PayCommandInput, ResponseEvent } from '@worldcoin/minikit-js'
            // ...
            useEffect(() => {
                if (!MiniKit.isInstalled()) {
                    console.error("MiniKit is not installed");
                    return;
                }

                MiniKit.subscribe(
                    ResponseEvent.MiniAppRequestPermission,
                    async (response: MiniAppRequestPermissionPayload) => {
                        if (response.status == "success") {
                            const response = await res.json();
                            // Handle the response
                        }
                    }
                );

                return () => {
                    MiniKit.unsubscribe(ResponseEvent.MiniAppRequestPermission);
                };
            }, []);
        ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
## Response type 
### Success response payload
``` ts
type MiniAppRequestPermissionSuccessPayload = {
    status: 'success';
    permission: 'notifications';
    timestamp: string;  // ISO-8601
    version: number;    // same version that was received from MiniKit
};
```
### Error response payload
``` ts
type MiniAppRequestPermissionErrorPayload = {
    status: 'error';
    error_code: RequestPermissionErrorCodes;
    version: number;
}
```

The possible error codes are:

-   `user_rejected` - User declined permission request
-   `generic_error` - Request failed for unknown reason
-   `already_requested` - User has already declined turning on notifications once
-   `permission_disabled` - User has notification disabled for World App
-   `already_granted` - User has already granted this mini app permission
-   `unsupported_permission` - Permission is not supported yet

## Sending notifications from Developer Portal

You can send notifications to multiple wallet addresses directly from the Developer Portal.

![Notification Interface in the Developer Portal](/images/docs/mini-apps/commands/notifications-dev-portal.png)

1. Enter wallet addresses separated by commas or import addresses via CSV file (Limited to 1000 addresses per request).

2. Add a notification title (up to 30 characters).

3. Enter your notification message (up to 200 characters).

4. Specify the path inside your mini app that will open when the notification is tapped.

5. Enter your Developer Portal API key (format: api\_...). You can obtain this from the API Keys tab.

6. Click the button to dispatch notifications to the specified addresses.

## Calling the notification endpoint

You can send notifications to this endpoint: https://developer.worldcoin.org/api/v2/minikit/send-notification.
For detailed information on the endpoint, see the [API Reference](/mini-apps/reference/api#send-notification).

Business rules about this endpoint

-   We do not allow marketing notifications. These should be purely functional notifications.
-   We do not allow notifications that are not related to the mini app.
-   We do not allow notifications that are not related to the user.
-   The endpoint is limited to 1000 users per call
-   Messages are limited to 200 characters
-   Titles are limited to 30 characters

## Testing

We currently have a limit of 40 notifications per 4 hours for unverified apps. This is to help you test your notification implementations.
Currently you will need to create a new app if your app is verified as it will default to the verified app's metadata. In addition, you need
to enable notifications for your mini app inside of World App to receive them.

## Success Result on World App

If implemented correctly, the user will see the following drawer on World App.

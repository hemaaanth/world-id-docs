# Data Indexing and Analytics

Data indexing solutions and other APIs streamline access to blockchain data, enabling efficient querying and real-time analysis of on-chain events. This is crucial for decentralized applications built on World Chain, as it reduces the cost of processing, and presenting data. APIs also facilitate 
third-party integration, enhancing developer experiences and expanding the ecosystem with more accessible, decentralized apps (dApps) and services.

## Allium

[Allium](https://allium.so/) is an enterprise blockchain data platform designed to provide accurate, fast, and simple access to blockchain data across over 70 blockchains and more than 1,000 enriched schemas. It offers tools for developers and analysts to build real-time applications and perform cross-chain data exploration with low-latency APIs and customizable workflows.

Allium features:
- Low-Latency APIs
- Data Freshness
- Real-Time Data Streams
- Decoded logs and traces

## Dune

[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/) is a blockchain data platform that enables users to query, visualize, and share insights from on-chain data.
It provides a powerful interface for querying blockchain information using SQL-like queries, allowing users 
to create custom dashboards and visualizations.

Dune's enhanced data accessibility and insights will give developers and non-developers on World Chain the
ability to:
- Explore metrics related to real humans interacting on the chain
- Track the performance of DeFi protocols and DEXes
- Explore onchain data of any public blockchain project

With Dune's comprehensive dataset and web-based app, anyone (with a little SQL knowledge) may quickly query World Chain data and create insightful dashboards.

## Goldsky

Goldsky makes it easy to access real-time web3 data with little maintenance.

[Goldsky Subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/introduction) let you intelligently extract blockchain data with ease. Goldsky Subgraphs are fully backwards compatible, but in addition, offer:
- a rewritten RPC layer, autoscaling query layer, and storage optimizations to improve reliability (99.9%+ uptime) and performance (up to 6x faster)
- webhooks support out-the-box to enable notifications, messaging, and other push-based use cases

[Goldsky Mirror](https://docs.goldsky.com/mirror/introduction) lets you replicate Subgraph data or chain-level streams directly to a data store of your choosing for highly flexible usage in your front-end or back-end. Out-of-the-box connectors for Postgres, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch, S3, Kafka, SQS, webhooks, and more mean that you can use the right stack for your use case.
